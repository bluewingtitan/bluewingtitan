# 👋 Hi! Hope you are doing great today!
#### I am Dominik, also known as bluewingtitan.

### Some basic stuff:
- 🏙️ Stuttgart, Germany
- 🏫 [HdM-Stuttgart](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/en), enrolled for [Computer Science and Media](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/en/prospective_students/academic_programs/bachelor_programs/steckbrief?sgang_ID=550033)

> Back in the days I wasn't able to understand code, but now I C#

### I am currently working on...
- ▶️ ... [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYJK_p4j89fJDlEQ5-gDoiA/videos) (Devlogs, other Indie-Game related topics) **\[DaVinci Resolve, Ableton\]**
- 🎮 ... [A Game](https://github.com/Five-Thousand-Kings/FriskyFarmers) about farming, for frisky friends finding fun. **\[unity3d, dotnet]**
- 📚 ... [MontyPlayer](https://github.com/Five-Thousand-Kings/MontyPlayer), a suite of tools aimed at building multiplayer experiences **\[dotnet, unity3d\]**
- 🎲 ... some random small side projects, some public, most private. **\[godot engine, react-native, angular, express, spigot, bash, a lot more\]**

> Sometimes using C is like bringing a gunfight to a knife and using assembly is like using orbital lasers for tatooing ants.

### More unsorted facts about me
- he/him.
- I am a passionate electronic musician, lyricist and It-guy.
- Not a prophet for any framework or lang. Just use the right tool for the right job...
- I am a bit picky about what I do, but if I am rolling with it, I want to make it right.
- I belive in open software and open minds.
- Linux is my daily driver (debian on servers, manjaro and popos on desktop), but I try not being prophetical about it.
- My go-to languages are C# and typescript. While I often work with other langs (ruby, python, java, plain ecmascript), most of my projects are either C# or ts/js. I am working with Unity3D or sometimes Godot for games and .Net for my game servers, but with ts and meteor or express for non-game backends. My most used frontend framework is react and I am working on an app with react-native since a few months.
